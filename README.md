Snoop-Dogg-Minecraft
=============

_Disclaimer: This application contains explicit language and references to drug use._

A resource pack for Minecraft 1.18 where all in-game text has been fed through Gizoogle.net's translator. Hilarity will ensue.

Adds the 'Gangsta' language to your options, and makes some changes to backgrounds. Also, the bell ringing noise is now _that_ sample from "The Next Episode".


Usage
---------------
For Minecraft 1.18.1. 
1. Extract into your resourcepacks folder (default on Windows is %AppData%\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks ). 
2. Select the "Snoop Dogg Language Resource Pack" in Settings>Resource Packs. 
3. Go to the languages icon (globe on main menu), and select "Gangsta (The L.B.C.)".
4. Enjoy!
